GitHub Guide Hello World

I still see your shadows in my room...can't take back the love that I gave you
Twitter fingers turn to trigger fingers
She told me put my heart in the bag and nobody gets hurt now I'm running from her love im not fast so Im making it worse
See you acting nervous I damn well did it perfect work hard and determined its safe to say i earned it WOAH
I told her to fly out she scared of the virus I sent her a private to get here
Got m's in the bank like yes indeed, cartier glasses i won't even peak at you, yellow ferari like pickachu
